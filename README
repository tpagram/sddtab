== Description ==

SDDtab is an SDD-based modal theorem prover for logics K and S4.

== Installation ==

To compile, enter 'make' in terminal within the sddtab directory. This will create the binary sddtab with the bin/ folder.
SDDtab has been tested on both OSX and Ubuntu.

== Usage ==

SDDtab reads modal formulae from standard input with the following options:

-k	Enabled by default. Solves the benchmark in modal logic K. Mutually exclusive with option -s4.
-s4	Solves the benchmark in modal logic S4. Mutually exclusive with option -k.
-v 	Enable verbose mode.
-sat 	If enabled, SDDtab will decide satisfiability. If not enabled, SDDtab defaults to deciding validity.
-size	SDDtab returns the size of the initial SDD constructed and does not solve the formulae.

SDDTab accepts formulae of the form:

f :: 	prop
	~f
	f | f
	f & f
	f => f
	f <=> f
	<>f
	[]f
	(f)

where prop is an alphanumeric sequence of characters.

== Usage ==

The scripts:

benchmark2.sh
benchmark2_size.sh

benchmark the highest instance solved and initial SDD size respectively for the LWB benchmark set.

Instructions and example commands are included within the scripts as comments.
